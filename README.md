# Neighborhood Maps Project 
This is the neighborhood maps project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree program.
I chose to make an all purpose recommendation app which pulls data from
foursquare about worthwhile places to visit based on the criteria and city
supplied by the user.  By default it displays a list of recommended coffee shops
in Portland.
The user can either click on the list items or the map markers to view more
details about the location and access a link to their entry on foursquare. 
Users can use the filter to filter location names by a text string or the
checkbox to filter for only locations labelled "verified" by Foursquare.
