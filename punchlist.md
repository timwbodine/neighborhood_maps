checkin/review data or whatever.
4.  adapt this so user can search for whichever city

NEXT STEP
//macro 1.
//1. set up basic knockout app.js and index.html
//2. figure out how to make asynchronous call to foursquare api from app.js
//3. connect foursquare api call to knockout model
//macro 2.
//1. Go through google maps API tutorials
//2. integrate map into existing knockout SPA.
//3.  Connect knockout data models to map API to populate map with locations.
